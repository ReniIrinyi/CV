    "short": "I've always really liked dynamic backgrounds, and when I first came across the particles library, I knew I would use it when I had a portfolio. I did a lot of research on the internet and finally realised that it was easier than I thought - and like most blogs and videos describe. So I decided to take a few minutes and write it down to give an easy tutorial for those who are also big fans of similar effects."
